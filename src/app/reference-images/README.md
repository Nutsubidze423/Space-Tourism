Reference images for Space-Tourism UI

Drop your screenshot files (JPEG/PNG) into this folder so I can read them and implement the design.

Recommended filenames:

- 01-home-desktop.jpg
- 02-home-tablet.jpg
- 03-home-mobile.jpg
- 10-header.png
- 11-header-active-state.png

Notes:

- Prefer images exported from Figma at 2x (or full desktop size) for accuracy.
- Keep filenames short and start with a 2-digit index to indicate priority.

When you've added the images, reply here with "images added" and I will:

1. Inspect the files, pick the primary screenshot, and implement the requested changes (underline position / hero layout).
2. Run tests and update `header.css` / other files as needed.

If you want me to add/convert images for you, attach them to this chat and I will place them here for you.
